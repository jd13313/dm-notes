# DM Notes
Tired of not finding the right tool for planning/tracking D&D campaign progress, I decided to start writing my own. May not actually go anywhere, but it's also a great learning exercise for nodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend. 

# Feature Ideas
1. Upload images (to s3)
2. Easy-use dice roller

# Commands
## UI
`npm start`

## Server
`node server.js`
